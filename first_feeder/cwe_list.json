Most of its content has been transferred to\n\tCWE-785.\n\n        This entry was deprecated for several reasons. The primary\n        reason is over-loading of the \"path manipulation\" term and the\n        description. The original description for this entry was the\n        same as that for the \"Often Misused: File System\" item in the\n        original Seven Pernicious Kingdoms paper. However, Seven\n        Pernicious Kingdoms also has a \"Path Manipulation\" phrase that\n        is for external control of pathnames (CWE-73), which is a\n        factor in symbolic link following and path traversal, neither\n        of which is explicitly mentioned in 7PK. Fortify uses the\n        phrase \"Often Misused: Path Manipulation\" for a broader range\n        of problems, generally for issues related to buffer\n        management. Given the multiple conflicting uses of this term,\n        there is a chance that CWE users may have incorrectly mapped\n        to this entry.\n\n\tThe second reason for deprecation is an implied combination of\n\tmultiple weaknesses within buffer-handling functions.

However, some of Fortify's Vulncat entries have the\n\tterm \"path manipulation\" but describe a non-overflow weakness\n\tin which the buffer is not guaranteed to contain the entire\n\tpathname, i.e., there is information truncation (see CWE-222\n\tfor a similar concept).
